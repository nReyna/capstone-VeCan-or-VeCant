The food and drinks were all amazingly delicious. I had the coconut curry soup, my girlfriend had the eggplant tempeh. We each got a drink off the summer drinks menu and had temaki cones to start. The food was flavourful and well-presented.

The server even thanked me for the generous tip I left, something most servers don't do. I'm a server myself so I know that lots of places don't acknowledge tips, good or bad, and that's just how it is. It was nice to hear a genuine thank you.

I loved all of the appetizers and the mains, but the eggplant appetizer and the greens in the main were especially amazing. The injera was fluffy and sour, the way it should be. I also tried one of the micro-brewed beers on the menu and it was great. The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that, given the ingredients used (lentils, split peas, veggies), it is quite pricey. $30 per person before tax/tip/drinks is a lot when every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to (and I've tried many!) has charged around $10-$15 while serving a similar amount of food. It's true that the quality at Nil Bleu is top notch, as was the service and ambiance, but it's hard to want to pay double what you would elsewhere for very similar food.

Initially I had no intention to drink but I waited so damn long to receive a menu and have my order I felt like it didn't make sense not to. From when I got there to when I ordered I kid you not it took nearly 45 minutes. I contemplated leaving a few times but I stayed because the reviews are so decent I just had to try. 

I had to ask for just meat and cilantro. They normally pre-mix everything in the tacos. I asked for corn tortilla, was served flour. I was too hungry to send it back. The damn carne asada was soooooo oily and salty. Unnecessarily salty actually. Bland rice. Bland beans. It wasn't until after I received my food that I realized that his place is known for its alcohol buckets. Not the food.

Tonight I ordered the orange chicken & burger to go. When I try a new place, I always order two dishes just in case one is not so great. The total meal cost a little over $14.00

The orange chicken was pretty bland and unfortunately soggy; which was sad because I only had a 9 minute drive back to my destination. Plus there was not much of the orange sauce on the chicken or in the container which would have been nice to mix with the white rice .

The burger was pretty tasty, it comes with fries. I didn't feel a need to add any additional toppings to it when I arrived home. I would definitely order this again.

The final verdict: the orange chicken was a bust, but the burger saved the night!! Four stars overall.

We decided that since our first visit occurred shortly after Planta opened, we would give it another shot. There would be no way the service could have been as poor as our first encounter. So, we went for lunch.

We were seated promptly and immediately asked the waitress to help us choose a NON fried, NON salad item from the appetizer selections that we could share since we had each ordered a salad as a main.  She suggested the butternut squash and mushrooms.  Great!  Ten minutes later an arugula salad topped with squash and mushrooms arrived.  Although salty, it was tasty but we we did ask our waitress why she suggested a salad to start when our mains were each a salad.  She just stood there and smiled. (NOTE: The menu mentions nothing about the squash and mushrooms being served upon a bed of arugula.  Hmmm...)

Thirty five minutes later as we watched table after table receive their hot entrees (might I add they were patrons who arrived AFTER we did) we began to wonder why our salads had not arrived.  Once again, we asked our waitress what was going on.  She looked dumbfounded and walked away as we watched her approach a young man at the front of the restaurant.  They exchanged some words, he turned around to look at us and then he walked directly to the back of the restaurant toward the kitchen.  As we sat there hungry and frustrated, we decided at that moment that this was a most disorganized and thoughtless establishment and it was time to leave. Five minutes later, as we were getting our coats on, the young man arrived at our table with two salads in his hands.  When we asked about the wait, he said there really wasn't an excuse excuse - it was simply a ""mix-up"".  At that point we told him how this very same situation we encountered only a month prior and we would not tolerate it AGAIN.  We offered to pay for what we had eaten but he apologized for the situation and told us just to leave.

Planta, it is so hard to believe you are a part of the Chase group.  In fact, you call yourself the CHASE HOSPITALITY GROUP.  There was nothing hospitable about our visits. The breakdown in communication is terribly apparent.  After my first review, someone from your restaurant reached out to me privately for my email address so they could chat with me further.  I immediately provided it.  Did anyone ever get back to me?  Nope!

My friend got the Zeke which is like an omelet wrapped in pita bread. In this particular dish there were also onions, green peppers and American cheese.

Both entrees were a little small and are a la carte so you may want to consider a side of sausage or something.

But we are most upset about the horrible customer service. We complained to them that the price was wrong (that they charged us too much) but they said it was actually too little (can you believe it?) and they made the price even higher!!!!! They said it was their mistake they had forgotten to charge us for the rice. 

When we ordered the entrees, the waitress asked us which kind of rice we wanted, brown or white, so we assumed all dishes came with rice. They didn't inform us that we had to pay extra for rice. It was so confusing. 

We are vegan and always go to many locations of Loving Hut in many cities around the world and I have to say that this has been the worst experience dining at Loving Hut ever! Not a chance we will go back there. 

It was their mistake to start with and they still dared to change the price to even higher after we had complained about being charged wrong. It was such an incredibly rude service. Who would do this to a customer? These guys should learn the art of customer service from Starbucks. If I could give it zero star, I would.

They were slow even though we were the only people in the restaurant from the time we got there to the time we left (11:30-1), but had suspiciously cheery attitudes and made sure we had enough coffee...very suspicious indeed!

The food was actually a delight.  We shared the Greek platter as an appetizer.  None of it was homemade, we could tell, but it didn't taste bad.  My boyfriend got the sweet potato burger which tasted like maple syrup, in a good way.  I ordered the curry chick pea burrito which was rich and filling.

The sweet potatoes were burnt black on the outside but not totally cooked and there were a few onion slices here and there. To be honest the chicken sausage patties were quite good.

I ordered medium poached eggs with the same sweet potato hash and chicken sausage. You guessed it, the eggs ended up being hard-boiled!

Even though I'm a small eater, my boyfriend and I could have easily split a second sandwich. I  guess it's a good thing the sandwiches are small...you can watch your calories.

"-27q0ghYIXUdcaAteO7szQ";"4";"2017-09-04 00:00:00";"Alors que Montréal est reconnue pour être une ville végé- et vegan-friendly, la plupart des restaurants végétariens et véganes sont concentrés dans le Plateau Mont-Royal et dans le Mile-End. C'est d'autant plus vrai quand on recherche une cuisine gastronomique et plus recherchée que l'offre habituelle. Le quartier Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, qui compte pourtant quelques endroits comme Mouton Vert, Vegan Rapide ou Espace Végane, n'a jamais été particulièrement prisé. Ça a toutes les chances de changer avec l'arrivée de Ashley's Health Bar, un nouveau restaurant (officiellement ouvert le dernier jour d'août 2017) qui vient de s'y installer et d'ouvrir ses portes.
Dès qu'on pénètre dans l'établissement, on est agréablement surpris par le décor: tables et murs en bois, ampoules accrochées au plafond, grandes banquettes et chaises noires, etc. On sent que l'expérience, résolument moderne, a été pensée et que peu de choses ont été laissées au hasard (incluant la tenue du personnel et les napkins sur les tables!). L'espace est relativement vaste et peut accueillir, à mon avis, une trentaine de personnes. Lorsque le temps le permet, une grande terrasse est également disponible.
Au-delà des traditionnels bols Bouddha que d'autres restaurants ont contribué à démocratiser à Montréal, Ashley's Health Bar offre un menu avec des influences variées: bol de chili (en format entrée ou en plat principal), curry, burger, sandwichs (incluant un Banh mi) et même 2 pizzas! Il y en a pour tous les goûts et j'apprécie également que la majorité du menu soit biologique et que les fruits et légumes proviennent de commerces du quartier. Je regrette toutefois que le menu complet ne soit pas végane ou, du moins, que les plats ne soient pas proposés en version végane par défaut (ce qui semble de plus en plus être la norme pour les restaurants du genre). Plusieurs plats sont toutefois exempts de produit d'origine animale et la quasi-totalité peuvent être véganisés sur demande (sans frais!). Tous les desserts, incluant la crème glacée à base de noix de cajou, sont également végétaliens. Dommage toutefois que les laits végétaux représentent un coût supplémentaire pour les boissons (comme un latte).
Les plats sont préparés avec attention et, même si quelques items (comme les dumplings aux légumes) manquent légèrement de goût, d'autres compensent largement. Entre autres, la pizza Belgrava est possiblement une des meilleures pizzas véganes à Montréal et le curry De Burma avec amour était délicieusement épicé. Le dessert Symphonie de la mangue porte bien son nom et était frais et nourrissant (en plus d'être santé!). Le rapport qualité-prix est raisonnable mais, par contre, les portions sont étranges (par exemple, un curry en plat principal avait la même taille que le bol de chili en entrée). J'imagine que l'ajustement se fera avec le temps!
Le lancement de Ashley's Health Bar a été assez discret mais, pourtant, c'est un très bel ajout à l'offre actuelle des restaurants végétariens et véganes à Montréal. Je suis aussi content de voir le quartier NDG prendre un tournant santé et plant-based. En croisant les doigts pour un menu en version végane par défaut dans le futur!

While it offers classic American cuisine, it also dares to take on ideas that play off classical American foods. Such examples are crispy chicken skins (a play on crispy chicken tenders) or hot oysters (a play on boneless chicken wings). When I went there, I tried to order items that aren't typically found on everyday menus. I ordered the chicken skins, the hot oysters, an asparagus burrata salad, and some crusted lamb. 

Most of the food was tasty and really interesting to try out. I never thought having chicken skins would work so well as an appetizer. The hot oysters were spicy, but I really liked the idea of trying an oyster that was coated with wing sauce and out of the shell. The burrata salad was quite unique; never have had a salad like that before, but the flavors inside the salad complemented each other. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Overall, I would recommend trying it out if in the area.";"0";"0";"0";"Carson Kitchen";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

Some places are phenomenal but bankroll-busting (Roka Akor). Some places are decent, but you're still overpaying (Stingray, Ra, everywhere else I've gone).

How Do You Roll? is a horribly-named chain out of Austin. It's the Chipotle of sushi, where you pick the ingredients, and some guy who looks like he belongs at Chipotle or Starbucks puts it together for you, and there are all kinds of options. It's disconcerting. Everything about this place seems like it'll suck.

But you know what? It's pretty damn good. I'm not saying this is the best sushi in town. I'm not even saying it's as good as somewhere like Stingray (which, as I mentioned, isn't all that great, either). But it's close, and you get what you want. And the best part? You don't feel like you're getting gouged. It doesn't even feel like going out.

I'm convinced How Do You Roll? is going to be a gamechanger. It's going to draw Americans to sushi who wouldn't have considered it otherwise. It'll be an affordable way for sushi lovers to get their fix. There's plenty to balk at (again, that name is AWFUL), but this is our new sushi default in the Valley.

ADDENDUM: After a third visit, some cracks showed. The seaweed wrap was doubled up or something, and became obnoxiously chewy. Then our cashier charged us for eight meats instead of four, and it took quite some time to remedy the situation. Also, I've got the feeling they're masking the taste of the sushi with sauce. (This is not a place for sashimi or nigiri.) Anyway, we'll try again, but I was scared off a bit.

I explained to her we have ordered many times before and it has always come in a styrofoam cup with a lid and she said that they only do that for the entree not the lunch special because the cups are more expensive. I kindly tried to explain there is no way you can expect a liquid to not spill out of a box that is not sealed. Needless to say customer service was not a major concern for her.

Like others have said, this isn't a place to go to feel better about your nutrition, it's by no means healthy.  But there's tons of salad restaurants out there for that.  This place satisfies vegan soul food like few others have done.  NYC used to have a place of this caliber but it closed, I hope Hogtown Vegan does not go the same route.

The ambiance is not amazing, do not take a date here, it doesn't exactly eschew 'romantic'.  And neither will him or her watching you plow into some 'chicken' and waffles.  But style points aside, this food is good.  I had the chicken and waffles, and that was an unmitigated success, waffles are often hit-and-miss at vegan places and this was a bull's eye.  My wife had the phish and chips and they were all the good parts of fish and chips without the bones, and death and all.

The service was good, not amazing or anything, but really fit the decor.  The parfait was good, I've had better and other places, but by the end of the meal, it didn't matter and didn't detract in the slightest.

If I had to find a complaint, i would say their hot sauce is nothing special, but I cannot imagine that is anyone's determining factor for some vegan soul-food.

The location is very small, but extremely clean and very pretty inside.  Most of the soups are $6.50 - 7.  

I tried the pork & fish ball soup because of another yelper's recommendation, and I was not disappointed!  I love that they offer 4 different choices of noodles, as I opted for the flat rice noodle.  Other noodle choices include: egg, vermicilli, or thin rice noodle.  Be careful with the little spice rack they bring out, as a little spice goes a long way.  Without meaning to, I overspiced my soup a bit, but it was still wonderful.  I just ended up drinking a lot of water and nursing my runny nose while enjoying my soup.  On my next visit, which will be very soon, I plan to try the Tom Yum soup.  Honestly, everything on the menu sounds great, which offers a full array of Thai dishes in addition to the soup.

We shared some appetizers- the ceviche and the mushroom strudel were both excellent; the cheese/ charcuterie plate was good/ not great.
I had the carbonara, which comes with a sunny side egg on top- a welcome twist on a classic dish. My pasta was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I tasted the hen, which comes with roasted root vegetables cooked in a sweet broth- the hen was beautiful and golden and crispy and delicious. Our whole group was pleased with their entrees. We shared beignets, which were light and not too sweet; the dipping sauces were tasty. 

We had a great experience. Our server was goofy, but very attentive. She made us nervous by not writing down our orders (all six!), but she got it all right, and the service was great.

The atmosphere was nice-- exposed brick walls, and crystal chandeliers, and the rope window treatment is fun to look at. It wasn't too loud in the dining room, though it wasn't full.

Entrees ranged in price from $15-25 and I felt like you got plenty of food and really good quality for what you paid.

I was awestruck when I found out that there are tons of options for vegetarians and vegans. 

We did have to wait about 30 minutes during lunch time but it was so worth the wait. We'd spent the weekend hitting up places in Chicago that had been featured on TV shows or had gotten rave reviews and this was the absolute best of the weekend.

Our waitress was super friendly and kept my water topped off the whole time (which was a little dangerous because we still had 10 more hours to drive). I got the vegan pig roast which was the monthly special and it ruled. The potato salad was so good as was everything else on the plate.

Quick and dirty notes:
Food: quality tasting with a big BUT (see full review below for details) BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN BONES!
Service: very slow and biased 


We come in for dinner TONIGHT ( that's how upset I am about this place)

We walked in and observed the ""please wait to be seated"" sign and obliged. It took 5 minutes before the staff noticed us and seated us. The place was pretty empty, I counted 4 tables in the back that were used. We were seated on the opposite end of the restaurant. 
The busser quickly sat us and brought us out some flat bread and chutney. The bartender quickly asked us if we wanted to order cocktails. That was the last interaction we would have for the next 20 minutes. I noticed the manager/owner at the front desk and tried to make eye contact with him to show him subtly that we were ready to order. My silent ques went unnoticed. I don't understand it?!? The waiters were nowhere to be found? 
Finally both of the waiters noticed and rushed to take our orders. There seemed to be an obvious disconnect between the staff and the tables that they were responsible for. Nevertheless we finally were able to place our order. 

We ordered
Samosas
Pakora (I wanted Aloo Tiki but they were ""out"")
1/2 order of Tandori Chicken
Butter Chicken 
Garlic Naan


The appetizers came out very quickly!

The Pakora was very large and tasty. I was a good mix of vegetables not just batter fried sliced veggies.

The samosas were very tasty and fresh! The peas in them were not gushy and the potato mix had a nice consistency to it. You could tell that they were made recently. 

The tandori chicken came out hot from the tandori still moist. Probably one of the better tandori chicken dishes that I've had. It was not marinated to long as the chicken protein was not completely broken down from the yogurt. Not sure how they do it but the meat was still moist and yet still had a nice red crust. 

That's about where to food compliments stop.The tandori chicken came out 10 minutes before our curry, rice and naan. We waited hoping that the other dishes would follow shortly but gave up after 5 minutes and begun to eat the chicken. What burns me even more is an Indian family that was seated long after us got their food (the same food) before us. Our food came our 3 minutes after they were served. Discrimination or just crappy service? You be the judge. This instantly infuriated me and ruined my experience from that point on.  

10 minutes later, we finally got the rest of our order. 
The butter chicken sauce was very creamy and tasty. The big complaint was the chicken in the curry. It was loaded with what seemed to be leftover tandori chicken bits (not chunks or cubes). I usually expect that but I should not have to pick out shards of bones out of my curry. UNSAT and UNSAFE!
I was unable to enjoy my curry as I had to be on the lookout for chicken bones.  

The food was very good but the misque on the butter chicken and the horrible service tainted what could have been a great dining experience. I think that their food is decent and I'd dare say that it's some of the better that I've had in Vegas but they need to get a grip on the staff before I'd dare come back to this place.";"4";"0";"0";"India Masala Bar & Grill";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

I finally made it down to Gilbert this morning, and now I hate myself for not discovering the glory of Thrive sooner (but really, I love myself, because I just had a giant acai bowl and am feelin' fine).

My favorite thing about Thrive is the ingredient selection, which tops anywhere I've been in California. They even beat out Sambazon's Acai Cafe, which is 100% build-your-own bowl style. Yes, there's a menu, but many a secret ingredient hides in the kitchen, including super foods like cacao nibs, goji berries, spirulina, maca powder, hemp and chia seeds. Other highlights include homemade nut butters, protein powders, all kinds of berries and tropical fruit, and hemp-flax or gluten-free granola.

I'm too excited by any restaurant's build-your-own option to order a set menu item, and given the myriad possibilities laid out before me... I knew the original bowl wasn't going to cut it. I made my own acai blend (spirulina, cacao nibs, chocolate protein powder, banana, and walnut butter) and topped it off hemp-flax granola, walnuts, and chocolate shavings. AY. DIOS. MIO. Too delicious for English words... and five hours later, I'm still full.

The owner was even sweet enough to let us try free samples of the tropical, chocolate peanut butter, and chocolate coconut bowls... which were unsurprisingly scrumptious. Overall, I'm left with these two thoughts: 1) Even if Thrive is 25 minutes away, I've got plans to fill out my punch card and get a 10th bowl free before the end of the month, and 2) Why is there only one of these? Time to start replacing Scottsdale's 473 crap-tastic FroYo places with acai cafes!";"7";"2";"4";"Genuine Fresche";"Gilbert";"AZ";"Vegan"

First, walking into the restaurant, the setting seemed very wrong to me, A table right by the front door and the front desk set back from it, so everyone entering is literally passing right next to your table, never mind passing it, they wait right next to you to be seated. Okay, perhaps trivial. Tables are set so close to one another you cant have a private conversion with your date. We were brought water right away, good start, orders taken promptly thereafter. Wife ordered Pad Thai with tofu, I ordered eggplant with chicken. But I also ordered the crispy spinach appetizer. So my wife's plate shows up around 10 minutes later and she is waiting for mine before she starts. I encourage her to enjoy it while its still hot, she noticed it didn't come with crushed peanuts as its suppose to. Another 5 minutes pass by before she could ask for them. My meal finally arrives. So for flavor of food I'll give it 4 stars but service is low 3. So now we have our meals and half way through them, my appetizer shows up. Personally, I should have said take it back. Appetizer is pre meal. The crispy spinach taste good but it was extremely oily. I understand this restaurant is new but prioritizing things shouldn't be so difficult.

Savoury Crepe (vegan mozzarella, tomato, basil, spinach, mushroom)
- agree with other reviewers on the bland flavours of the savoury crepes
- the vegan cheese was rather displeasing and I think this crepe would've been better without it
- pretty pricy at $15
- the crepe itself was fine; the sweet crepes might be tastier considering it's easier to make a sweet vegan crepe using fruits vs a savoury one

Salad
- a mix of different legumes, quinoa, kale, nuts mixed together
- this was OK but I wouldn't eat again

We accidentally stumbled onto CBP when we were going to a different place in the area.  My hubby was set on the other place but when we saw the big lunch special sign out front, we had to investigate.  I mean ANY PIZZA for $6.95 would get anyone's attention I think (this special is Monday-Friday 11am-3pm.)  When I went in to grab a menu to check out, I was sold on pizza for lunch just from the smell of the place!  There was no eating a boring sandwich after smelling the delicious pizzas baking in the oven.

I really liked the whole idea of this place as well.  It was like going to Subway where you walk down the line and point to the items you want on your pizza.  The choices are quite numerous and plentiful.  The toppings all looked super fresh and colorful.  There were several options for crusts, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and proteins.  There must be at least 1000 combos you can make, if not more.  They also have already designed pizzas, if the toppings are too overwhelming for you.  Since we were there for the lunch special time, we could actually get unlimited toppings, if we had chosen to do so.  Instead we went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with extra mushrooms because everything is better with mushrooms!  Both were super tasty and had so much flavor.  The thin crust was crisp with a great crunch.  The cheese was ooey gooey and browned just perfectly.  The pepperoni was spicy and delish!

The best thing was our pizzas were prepared, cooked, and boxed up in 5 minutes flat.    That is some awesome pizza service right there.  We very much enjoyed the pizzas and had nothing left over afterwards because we are pizza piggies.  

I would give this place a solid 4 stars but the staff here totally pushes them to a 5 star rating.  Maurice was working the counter when I arrived.  He could tell I was new and slightly confused, especially since I was at the wrong end of the counter trying to order, so he took me under his wing and showed me the light.  He walked me through everything and was describing each step with the greatest of detail.  He spoke about the pizza as if it was his first born child!  His descriptions made you want the pizza right that second.   He totally made the experience amazing.  Both of our pizzas were works of art created by the one and only Maurice the Pizzaman!

However Thanjai truly is exceptional. If you are into the real flavours of Indian food you must come try This South Indian treasure. They deliver something intriguing and tongue tingling (flavour wise ). Also it's about a chef who can mix and deliver Indian spices that compliment and can contrast flavours in a meal. 

With over 60 Dosas on the menu I had to try one. For those who have never tried Dosa it's a crispy crepe type texture filled with potato and spices whereby you break off small pieces and dip by hand in one of the three accompanied sauces. The Dosa I ate for lunch was PHAV bhaji (Mumbai street style). One of the sauces was a chickpea very nice and light. The other was a milk or yoghurt base which was cooler milder and the other was a creamy one. Healthy and flavourful and crazy amazing! 

After my meal to continue on with the great flavour I ordered two dishes to go for dinner that evening. One was vegetable biryani the other chilli chicken. The chicken was ordered as a medium which was adequate spice level for me. Chicken was in a rich red sauce which was sweet but had some good spice kick to it. The biryani was so flavourful of mint, coriander and cardamom that I need to come back and indulge in more. 

On the menu I LOL about the spice levels:  of Spicy, Super spicy or Supreme spice. I can only imagine the heat level of a Supreme spice. It could be akin to seeing new colours in the air and Hindu characters dancing around you while in a hallucinating dream land. 

They claim to be able to do a six foot family style Dosa. It would be a great place for a group event for those who are hungry! 

I asked the people working there if they were from Tamil Nadu and they confirmed yes. Then I complimented them on the fantastic flavours of the meal and said how much I enjoyed it.

The seitan for the asada is flavorful, however, the texture is too spongy for my taste.  The al pastor seitan had the same type of spongy texture as the asada, but this one lacked  flavor. I wouldn't order it again. 
 What I  was really pleased with  was the sope. The dough was not greasy, not undercooked, not too thick.  Also, the beans were on point, soft and had its own flavor. The sour cream didn't  really taste like anything and the shredded cheese looked more like mozzarella cheese  instead of queso fresco or cotija which is what it's  traditionally served with.
The horchata water was by far the only item you couldn't  that was vegan. It had that sweet and cinnamony taste that regular horchata has.
I knocked down 3 stars due to the following:

So, I left this place thinking about giving it 3 stars, maybe 4, maybe. However,  around dinner time I called in to place an order for a pick up. I knew they closed at 8:00 PM and it was 7:40 already which is why I called it in. A man answered the phone and when I asked him if I could place an order for a carry out, he paused and said "" you wanna place an order right before we close?"" Mind you, they still had another 20 minutes to go. How rude. I told him I knew that and would be there within 10 minutes. He then proceeded to take my order.

Also, the establishment seemed cleaned but it was extremely hot in there and when I arrived the cashier lady was all by herself at the front. She was taking orders, taking them out, cleaning tables. She was really hustling. And she (cashier/bus lady/server) told me  that the A/C wasn't working  properly so maybe I just went on the wrong day. No big deal. Regardless, the place is missing decorations. The walls seemed to have been painted recently  with a burnt orange color. And that's all that was done to it. Also, the chairs and tables are extremely worn down.

The wrap was large (I could only eat 1/2 of it) and it came with a simple green (think super greens) salad with a balsamic dressing. The wrap was mostly shredded lettuce, but it also had a fair share of the soy chicken, and the buffalo sauce (comes on the side) was yum! It was good, and it was just what I needed. The next time I'm in Vegas I will go back to try some of their other vegan food options.

Now, on to desserts. OMG First of all, there were not just one or two vegan options. There were MANY options for cakes and cookies. I finally settled on three (yes, 3): 
1- Hot Fudge Sundae Cake: I don't know if I should say anything, because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone. The icings were reminiscent of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, it had a chocolate ganache (the hot fudge), sprinkles, vanilla cake, and a surprise filling inside, which made me want to do back flips. So rich, I could only take 1 bite.

2- Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake: a chocolate cake, chocolate icing, strawberry, a chocolate chip cookie piece on top, and the surprise chocolate chip cookie dough in the middle. SO delicious and very rich; again, I could only eat 1 bite. You could easily split this with 4 people, or have enough to last a few days.

3 - Lemon Raspberry Cream Cake: lemon infused cake and icing with raspberry. The perfect sweet & tart combination.

The cakes were $6.50 each, and very much worth every penny. This place should be a ""must do"" on every vegan's list, esp those with a sweet tooth.

I met up with my sister for a weekend in Vegas. We decided to have brunch before her flight and we truly left the best for last with Go Vegan Cafe. This location is a bit off the beaten path, but there's only so much of the Strip I can take in one sitting. 

We arrived minutes after they opened and had the covered patio all to ourselves. (I believe I spotted air conditioning units, which is necessary in Vegas heat) Our server was warm and friendly and answered our questions​ about the extensive menu and provided great suggestions for our newbie experience. We finalized our choices to: the omelet and raw collard greens wrap. We also added the breakfast sausage because the server told us it was house made. 

I've had a couple vegan omelets in the Boston area and, while they were both amazing, they resembled more of a crispy crepe than​ an omelet. That was not the case here. With a fluffy, souffle-like texture, it was the closest thing to the real deal I've ever had. The oat-based sausages were equally amazing. (Double check with your server if you're gluten free) As a bonus, a little muffin came as an accompaniment to our omelet. So much bang for your buck with this dish! To my absolute delight, it ended up being a seasonal strawberry rhubarb and it was perfectly baked. It was a ""This is vegan!?"" moment, for sure. The collard wrap was refreshing to eat as we felt the desert air start to warm up. The crisp wrap and creamy filling was a satisfying combination.

After our meal, we walked over to the register by the front door and saw the workers stocking the salad bar, in case you are in need of a quick meal. Another FYI, they give you stevia with coffee. I'm​ particular about coffee and think stevia leaves a bit of a metallic taste, but it didn't affect me since I carry around a travel size maple syrup in my purse. The coffee itself is cold-brewed, which means it's less acidic and easier on your tummy. Ever notice when milk looks curdled when you pour it into your coffee? That's a reaction to an acidic brew.";"11";"8";"8";"Go Vegan Cafe";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

We entered the well lit, clean, welcoming place. We were greeted by a bubbly gal named Andrea. Since I'd never been there, she pointed me over to her colleague Stephen who would take care of us. Boy, did Stephen er Steven know his stuff! He explained to us that we get to custom build our own pizza and patiently answered all our questions on toppings. I ended up getting honey wheat crust with half plain marinara and half spicy red sauce (they explained to me they could do that after letting me try the hot sauce and it was too hot). I added mozzarella, artichokes, red onions, green onions, spinach, and cilantro. 

We sat down and waited only like 10 minutes for a freshly made pizza. It was sooo tasty! And our service was incredible. If you're the manager of this place, and you're reading this, you need to recognize these two! I though Steven had to be the manager!

I ordered the latke burger dressed with vegan tzatziki, tomato, pickle and lettuce on a whole wheat burger bun, served with potato wedges. There was a long hair on my plate under the burger so that wasn't a great start. I threw it away as a reflex before I could say anything to the waiter so that's on me. But how did they not catch that? The patty itself was made of sweet potatoes and beets so that was pretty yummy. I also liked their vegan tzatziki but their potatoes were bland and the pieces were way too large.

My sister ordered the BLT that comes with coconut chips instead of bacon. The wrap was so huge she had to take half home and it doesn't even come with a side! She would have preferred if the wrap was half the size but with interesting sides like a soup & salad. 

I hated that they sat us near the window as it was way too hot there from the sun. The people who got to sit away from the windows were better off. The banquette side is pretty uncomfortable so I just wanted to leave the whole time. The service was great though. Fast, friendly, polite. The food legit came out within 5 mins!

We shared a large berry smoothie, which was delicious and refreshing. We also tried the banana chocolate pie; it was rich and decadent. Yum. I just wish that instead of a coconut crust, it was a graham cracker one. They should describe it or make it more clear on the menu.

So overall, I feel like the menu relies too heavily on soy substitutes (tofu & tempeh) to replace animal products, unlike at Green Panther, Crudessence, Lola Rosa, etc. I'll probably give their new Westmount location a try when it opens since it's so close to me but I think if I'm craving healthy, I'll just go to Mandy's or Green Panther.

The dreary details: It was our 2nd time here, hence the review. Pretty consistent with our first visit a year ago. Went for lunch both the times as a party of 4. All dishes were ordered at a spice level of 7/10. 

First came the sweet lassi (yoghurt with sugar) and my friends got the cumin/pepper water drink. We liked both.

Our appetizer was the tandoori platter, a combination of the 3 meats below,

Sheek Kabab - Excellent. Will repeat it. The meat's flavor enhanced perfectly with mild herbs & spices.
Chicken Kabab - A tad dry but with the red Chilli sauce, it was good.
Shrimp - Will pass next time. Not well marinated in the spices. Was bland I thought.

Followed by, 

Bhatura - Excellent. Deep fried but not soaking in oil. Soft and yum (psst.. Have a huge weakness for fried food)
Chole - Okay. 
The mixed vegetable pickle that came with it was so homely.. and the 3 together - \m/ :)

Chicken Tikka Masala - Thanks to fellow yelpers, we tried it and have no regrets.
Rogan Gosht - Made of Lamb (should have been Mutton). Okay. Overpowering tomato taste, may not try again. Both curries came with plain basmati rice.
Garlic Naan (yeah.. Not done with our order yet. We had soooo much food) - Excellent. Wouldn't always get such soft, garlicky naans even back home in India. 
Aloo (Potato) Kulcha - Good.

Finally, the Chicken Biriyani. Bad. Was more like Pulav. The rice was sticky, not very flavorful. Won't try that again. But the rest of the gang (very Indian husband and 2 American friends) liked it. I like the biriyani at Kabab Palace better.

That's about it. We went at noon on a Saturday and were served without much wait time. They actually do allow reservations as early as 11:30 am. Staff are friendly. Though overpriced, we shall return to try other delicacies from their long list of menu items. For instance..

Pomegranate Cafe's ambience is inviting. Tables outside as well as lots of seating inside. 

My honey and I got the BBQ jackfruit Mac n cheese and the Harvest burrito. The Harvest burrito donates $1 of purchase to wildlife which is the reason we decided to get it.

The jack fruit was delicious! My omnivore boyfriend was dumbfounded how yummy it was (mostly the fact jackfruit taste exactly like pulled pork).

The Harvest burrito was a miss, we were both pretty disappointed. The quinoa overtook the whole burrito instead of adding to it. 

We came on a Saturday night and the service was pretty slow, but the servers seem like they all help each other out so no one has to wait too long. 

Over all super cute! Like any other vegan and/or locally sourced place your dollar won't stretch far. Burrito, Mac n cheese, a shake and two desserts was $50 not including tip. $$

It lives up to the 'express' in its name. The owner didn't have us sitting for long with an empty spot on the table. We wanted to try everything, so more or less ordered the whole farm.  Meat, fish, poultry, herbs and veggies, grains, roots, legumes, fruit, dairy. It was like a continuous parade of platters were being marched to our table and the owner accommodated us with extra plates to serve the food.  

All dishes are suitable for one person, but if you don't come with a big appetite two people can share a plate and still get full. I managed to finish ev'ry bite with no leftovers. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

The nitty-gritty on the dishes: 

- Date shake. How do you say YUM? I could wake up and drink that stuff for breakfast. It was thick, peanut-y, and not too sweet. Bet I could work through the entire morning on one date shake. Protein shake? We don't need no stinkin' protein shakes. We gots date shakes, B-otch.
- Tea was okay. Maybe if it was served after the meal and a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more. 
- Hummus was deliciously flavourful. I could eat a tub of it.
- Bread was a round of light fluffy flour that I prefer much more than pita. 
- Couscous side was absolutely delicious by itself. Whatever seasoning he used to give that salty/cheesy flavor was a surprise to the taste buds. And the texture was perfect. I took some to go and ate it by itself in front of the telly. Instead of handfuls of buttered popcorn, I had my spoonfuls of cheesy steamed couscous. What?!  Don't think I'll ever ask for another pot of boiled couscous. Steamed only going forward.
- Couscous salad. Mmmm-meh. Call me boring, but I prefer green salads. Gotta get greens.
- Lamb couscous was tender and cooked just right.
- Tangines were delicous.  Spiced right and flavourful, not at all oily - obviously simmered in their own juices. 
- Bastilla. My first time having it. If I re-order, it would have to be as a main dish with lots of side veggies. I like the top sweet crunchy phyllo but could do without the powdered sugar.  

Nitty-gritty on the decor:

Simple and tasteful. Decorated with hookahs, food stuffs, and Argan oil for sale. Changes have been made since the earlier reviews this year. To get an idea of the new layout, see the image that reviewer Franko L uploaded on May 11, 2015. There are about five small tables inside and one for a larger party. The center of the dining area is completely open so it has the appearance of plenty of space. Outside there are two large wooden tables. 

Separate restrooms for fe/male is great for a such a small place but if you wish to avoid any claustrophobic winces and cramping I suggest you use the loo before getting to the restaurant and carry wet-naps to clean your hands before eating.

Nitty-gritty on the owner:

A genuine host. There were other customers dining as well and they were getting served just as fast as us. Obviously the owner knows what he's doing. Definitely in his element with this petite-sized venue. He encouraged paced dining, conversation, and pure enjoyment of the meal. No customers were rushed into ordering or paying.

Expectations:

I wish there were more vegetables in the meals rather than so many potatoes. The few veggies I had were overcooked.

The first thing that caught my eye is that they use Grass Fed beef for their burger, but I saw right under it a delicious looking Lamb Burger with combination of traditional Greek ingredients. I can say right now, it was very tasty. Great lamb flavour. Locally sourced and happy with the fact it was made gluten-free.

Yes, it's Cash only. Yes, it's all vegan. But don't let that be a dealbreaker - because you'll be missing out on some of the most amazing comfort food. Our favorite is the ""McMaiden sandwich"" on Saturday morning brunch, however. It is PERFECT, and there is no sacrifice in taste or quantity of food - the ""egg"", the ""cheese"", the ""bacon"". Absolutely crave-satiating. The roasted potatoes give all other breakfast diners a run for their money. These potatoes don't even need condiments (and I'm a total Pittsburgh basic b*tch that puts Heinz on everything potato). I could also eat the Kale 'Em All salad every single day with every single meal. 

Sometimes I want to be gluttonous and order two meals at a time for myself - but then I wouldn't have room for the donuts. And WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE FROM!!! #firstworldproblems There are usually some classic favorites to choose from (like the chocolate-mousse filled ""Cronos""), and then some surprise flavors that have cereal, or pretzels, or ""Blood Stains"" on top. No matter what flavor we have tried, they all just seem to melt in your mouth. 

The music, menu items, and atmosphere is also great for those who love Rock music, of all kinds. There's even a poster from Club Laga, for all of us old Pitt kids. Even if you're not a fan of Rock, the decor isn't obnoxious, and the music ranges from classic to metal to punk to ska. No one is left out.

This is a vegetarian chinese restaurant. I am not a vegetarian but like to come here once in a while for a change. 

This restaurant has been around for many many years. I used to be a regular customer there when we lived in the area. We moved so we don't get to eat here as frequently as I would like. The quality of food remains good after so many years.

The restaurant looks dodgy, but food is good and portions are large; great value.
Dinner for a group of 6 people cost us $50 with apps and entrees.

Appetizers:
- immitation duck: my all time favorite, delish
- spring rolls: my least favorite , too much cabbage. I would prefer soya rolls
- taro rolls: if you like taro (a type of yam), you will like this. Very rich and filling.
- soya rolls: yummy with bamboo shoots and chinese mushroom. I would recommend it 

Entrees, we tried:
- Buddha mixed vegetables fried noodles: chow mein was crispy. One of my fav
- general tao chicken: I'm not a big fan, too doughy but my friends loved it
- mock beef with tofu BBQ sauce: delish, highly recommend it. The tofu was so flavourful 
- stir fried green beans with soy: good flavour, I liked the beans 

Overall, good reliable vegetarian chinese food with large portions at very reasonable price. If you're looking for a fancy sit down place, this is not the place for you. The manager (or owner?) was super nice and friendly";"2";"0";"1";"Buddha's Vegetarian Foods";"Toronto";"ON";"Vegan"

The reason I preface my review of lunch with what I had for breakfast is I want you to appreciate how hungry I was. When you cut bread and sugar from your diet, staying satiated for longer than the run time of a long movie is pretty much out the window. The plus side is you can eat more without gaining weight on account of your body not being able to rely on that sweet sweet sugar for energy. 

The negative? When you do wait, like I did, for a traditional meal to eat (to be fair, I fell asleep watching lectures on YouTube. Don't judge my Saturday) you get super hungies. So I'm yelping, and  I find this well reviewed kebab place about a 15 minute drive down 74, or in charlotte terms, down the street. I could really go for some lamb at this point, so I throw on some clothes and hit the door. 

I pull into Sycamore Commons, a shopping area I frequent, so imagine my surprise when the Google box directs me to this secluded little alcove behind the Best Buy, replete with shops and a massage envy,  and a sweet frog. Amongst them is the kebab place. 

The hostess seats me outside facing the fountain. The set up of the main dining room is slick, because no matter where they seat you, you walk by a deli style display case featuring ready to cook skewers of beef, of chicken, of salmon to whet your appetite. The outdoor seating area has nice stylish large umbrellas to keep the sun at bay. 

The menu is classic Mediterranean, all lamb and mint and tsaziki. I ordered minced lamb - which comes in a kebab and is served with basmati rice, a tabouleh salad and hot tea. If you recall the opening paragraph, you'll remember the low carb thing, and wonder why I didn't sub out the rice for, like, a chicken wing or something. Well i, in fact, did sub it out for the Spicy Lebanese salad.

Then the spiral downward started. My order came out, and boy howdy was it wrong. The first transgression: no tabouleh. I love tabouleh. It'd been over a year since I had it, and my excitement to have it again was severely dampened by the distinct lack of it on my plate. I did get rice, though. Rice I didn't want because of the low carb thing. I tasted it. It was good. Exceptional even. Especially the carrot slaw they had on top. But still, low carb is in effect,  so I couldn't actually enjoy the rice. 

Second transgression: the Spicy Lebanese salad, which came out as a side was fine. But it was out as a side and not the rice substitute that I wanted it to be. I ate it. It was pretty good, not quiet what I wanted it to be, but solid enough. 

Third transgression: as I approach the bottom of my salad i have decided not to complain (because God clearly wanted me to have that rice and not tabouleh, otherwise he wouldn't have put the rice and not the tabouleh in front of me). I look again at the fountain. It's very nice, calming. Relaxing.  Three spires in white plaster or stucco, can't really tell from where I am, with water cascading down the bronze or tiled (again, can't tell) centers. It's a good fountain. I bite down on my salad, and to my horror, there's a crunch that matches no other crunch in the salad to that point. And the crunch has a bitterness, and a dryness. I spat that bite out to reveal splinters of charred black something. I was now upset. 

No tabouleh? Forgivable. Rice when I can't eat it? Cruel, but I can look past that. But burned splinters in the salad? A bridge too far. 

Now you're probably thinking that this is a 1 star, no recommendation review. You'd be only half right. I'm not going to recommend kebab-je because they made a Slack first impression. However they should thank the server, because no sooner than I brought the various transgressions to his attention, did he not only comp my burnt splinter salad, but he did also bring me to-go tabouleh, which is second only to during the meal tabouleh on the tabouleh depth chart.

Plus the kebab was tasty (could've used a dipping sauce, but I liked it). And until it was burnt, the salad was good. And the rice was delicious. And my water cup wasn't empty until I left.

I probably won't be back for a while, though.

*P.S., the owner has apologized and invited me back. Adding a half star to My review for the consideration. Also the tabouleh was among the best tabouleh I've had. Easily one of the 3 best salads in Charlotte. Adding another half star for the tabouleh alone.";"2";"2";"1";"Kabab-Je Rotisserie & Grille";"Matthews";"NC";"Vegan"

My only experience with Jackfruit previously was an ex-girlfriend that was eating dried chips of it she fell in love with on a trip to Thailand. Our helpful waitress explained that Jackfruit has two different textures depending on how ripe it is. That is Jackfruit is meaty and perfect for shredding when unripe and is slightly sweet when fully ripe. When I say helpful waitress I really mean it. This visit was with a friend of mine with gluten & other food allergies. The waitress helpfully answered questions of what would be safe for my friend and what the cooks could do to change up what items. We ended up both ordering the Jackfruit Tacos, with slight modifications to my friends order.

When our food arrived and I had my first bite I was an instant convert. The jackfruit tacos were amazing just a wonderful spicing and such texture. The only clue I wasn't having carnitas was just a little hint of missing umami. Even then so many flavors were in this dish it is the number one thing you should order. I capped my my meal off with a peanut butter cupcake with chocolate icing that was also delicious.

Lest this review be one sided I went back for dinner a week later. This time I ordered the buffalo tofu finger with side orders of zucchini & kale. The sauce that came with it was almost a tzatziki but it paired well with the buffalo sauce that was spicey but not overly so and most importantly not oily. The only downside to this experience is their sweet tea isn't very sweet. However, they have have sugar in the raw & sweet n' low if you prefer your beverage equine fatal.";"8";"1";"5";"Bean Vegan Cuisine";"Charlotte";"NC";"Vegan"

I think it's nice that the menu includes some fake meats. I gave up meat for different reasons, but I do like having fake meats once in a while, especially if I'm craving it. So even if those dishes aren't the most creative, it's a great thing to have for people who miss meat (or non-vegas/non-vegetarians).

It was missing this quality that I can't put my finger on that I had in all the dishes when I was in Thailand. Thai food in America is all very saucy, pungent, and overpowering -- which, don't get me wrong, can be INCREDIBLE sometimes. But the beauty of the Thai food in Thailand is that it's not very saucy, pungent, and overpowering, but still maintains this tastiness that I've never experienced in America.

Until now. 

Komol Restaurant is the most authentic Thai restaurant that I've ever had in America. 

Just take their Pad Thai for example -- it's probably less saucy and orange-colored than you're used to. The Pad Thai flavor isn't as strong, but for some reason, each bite releases a delicious taste that isn't like the overpowering and sweet Pad Thai that you're used to in America. Even the Pad See Ewe, which is usually dark brown because of the overuse of soy sauce, has a lighter hue at Komol, but still packs in all of the unique flavor that Pad See Ewe should have.

The Herbal Salad, which is highly reviewed on Yelp, was good, but a little too pungent. It's like your typical Rainbow or Tea Leaf Salad at your local Burmese joint, but with way too many overpowering flavors.

The curries (Panang and Masamun) are both delicious, but these are more standard tastes that are pretty much the same in Thailand and in America.

Also, they make an excellent Thai iced tea.

I don't want to sound like a Thai food snob or connoisseur. It's very likely that I have no idea what I'm talking about. But I love Thai food and I love the Thai food I had when I was in Thailand. I'm not a professional -- just speaking from personal experience, and this is what I know to be true for myself. What I know to be true now is that you're not going to get a more authentic Thai food experience than at Komol.";"4";"0";"3";"Komol Restaurant";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

Upon arrival on a Thursday evening with a group of 4 we were told there was a 45 min wait. No problem there at all. We know the drill and have eaten at many small and popular  places in the past. We grabbed drinks at the bar and snagged a seat by the super nice fire pit.  About 45 min later the hostess comes out and says that their larger tables are done dining but are still chatting. Again, I understand. I run a small business in the service industry myself and these things can be hard to manage. Another 20 min goes by with smaller parties getting seated one after another.  The hostess again comes and apologizes saying the other parties just simply wont leave.  After ten more minutes one of our guests actually kindly approached one group of guests at the bar and explained the situation and they gladly gave up their bar seats.  It is a bummer to have to sit at a bar with 4 people after such a long wait but such is life.  

Upon sitting at the bar it seemed pretty clear that the bartender either was having a rough night or just didn't quite appreciate our presence. However, the old fashioned she made for me was delicious.  That was about the only thing any of us enjoyed during the visit.  I was stoked to try the gyro tacos and was incredibly disappointed. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the oxtail risotto was pretty awful.  Sitting at the bar we struggled  to get our waters refilled and never got any sort of acknowledgment or apology for our 90 minute wait for bar seats after being quoted a 45 min wait. We just sat quietly disappointed eager to finish eating and leave.  I am not sure that I have ever left a negative review for a restaurant nor have I ever sent a dish back. Generally, I am pretty patient with mistakes especially when they are acknowledged, but I was shocked by the lack of hospitality we experienced.  It is also worth mentioning that while we were leaving, the party that was holding up the table was still sitting down with their food in to-go containers just talking.  

This place is cool and interesting but lacks heart.  It felt like they wanted our money and for us to ""ohh"" and ""ahh"" over their ""innovation"" but at the end of the day it never felt like the staff had any interest in making you feel comfortable, seen, or appreciated. While leaving this review I noticed the way the owner responds to negative feedback that he feels is unwarranted. I cant help but think that sort of culture is exactly what contributed to our experience.  Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this place is as awful as I think it is. Either way, I think there are a lot better places to spend your money and time while in Vegas.";"3";"1";"0";"Carson Kitchen";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

My friend and I had dinner here. Driving from El Paso to Los Angeles, we had become sick of Chex Mix and energy drinks. I didn't realize La Santisima had been featured on Food Network's Triple D, but the Guy Fieri memorabilia gave it away immediately. In a fantastically awkward moment made possible by fourth generation cellular technology, we watched the restaurant's Food Network VODs right as the server came to take our order. The server let us finish watching.

There were more tacos available at the restaurant than its online menu currently displays. The veggie tacos I ordered were a classic guac, black bean, pico, and lettuce combination. They also offer a grilled zucchini type side for those that are looking to avoid eating rice. The food was fantastic. The freshness was palpable and the flavors were balanced. With so many salsas to choose from, I felt like a child in a candy store. Did I mix salsas? You bet I did. Maybe people should start saying, ""I felt like Chris at a salsa bar.""

The restaurant had an odd atmosphere. Maybe it was the mermaid skeleton with dollar bills clipped to it. La Santisima wasn't quick - despite being an odd hour in the afternoon, our food took quite some time. They also charged for every basket of chips past basket numero uno. I'm sure the United Federation of Restaurants that Proudly Serve Chips and Salsa was furious at the first member restaurant to offer unlimited chips - that restaurant set a ridiculous expectation!

Chili: very bland, overpowered by large pinches of cumin. Very meaty, which was nice, but was disappointed that it didn't come with a side of cornbread or some sort of bread. 
Hummus: also pretty bland and comes with side of pita, which I used some for the chili. I wasn't super impressed, I would recommend maybe a variety of veggies to accompany it. 

Perhaps it was just a poor choice of food that I ordered, but then again, if this place is that good, anything ordered should be delicious.

I ordered a glass of Mango Tea and the Burger to try since burgers are usually the ""staple"" of Vegan restaurants, that's what I usually use to judge if it's good or not. 

The Mango Iced Tea came in a glass filled to the brim with ice, so you can expect it to be completely watered down. I have a couple sips and decided to stick to the water since it lacked flavor.

The burger was extremely underwhelming, it had a weird mushy texture, unlike most burgers from the good vegan places I have tried where it's at least crunchy on the outside, not here, it seems they molded some beans and cooked grains together and put it on the bun. I did not like the fact it also fell apart so easily in your hands. I felt extremely disappointed 

(If Denny's can cook a better veggie burger than you...you know something is off ...) 

The only good thing about my visit was the 5 slices of Fries they served with the burger, which came with a very decent chili sauce. Very unfortunate at the very small side was the best part about my experience here.

So I've eaten here twice and the first time was a year or so ago and I couldn't tell you what I had, but all I remember was that it was good!  So I went back again a couple of weeks ago.  All I have to say is HOLY MOLEY  the Gouda Brizza is insanely good!  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it.  I wanted something different.  I was sick of srambled eggs and bacon for breakfast and I didn't want anything sweet, so I thought I'd give it a try.  So I took a bite into it and it was indulgence at it's finest.  I knew instantly that I would have to do cardio for an hour just to burn a quarter of the calories off from this, but OH man is it worth it!  The egg on it is super thin and is covered with the hollandaise sauce and cheese then topped with bits of bacon sprinkled perfectly everywhere.  Even my 20 month old son who refuses to eat meat ate this and didn't even realize he was eating bacon, because it was soo delicious!

But after dining at Moroccan Paradise across from ASU, I liked it so much that I decided to try another Moroccan restaurant the following day. That's when I discovered Couscous Express, which I read is famous for their couscous and date shakes.

When I entered Couscous Express, I was personally greeted by owner-chef Abdul who hails from Tangier, Morocco. Even before shown the menu, he had dropped off a few complimentary starters - a warm cup of bitter gunpowder tea, a bowl of mildly spiced hisara soup that was lentil based, and a microwaved piece of harsha that's like a thick disc shaped pan fried bread. Abdul told me to take my time, he would take my order after I finished the appetizers. I have eaten at Arabic restaurants where a hearty lentil soup is the first item served, and the hisara soup tasted very similar to that. It's like the ""miso soup"" of Middle Eastern meals. 

The menu was very simplistic, permutations of either kabobs or tagine, with the choice of vegetable, chicken, beef, fish, or lamb. For that reason, there was no paper menu passed out. Just tell Abdul what you want. I chose the lamb tagine, after having had chicken the previous night.

The tagine was essentially an individual serving potted stew, very soupy, containing a melange of boiled vegetables, raisins (instead of dates), and meat. I ate it with steamed couscous which was prepared reasonably well - very moist and soft, somewhat fragrant, a hint of raisin-like sweetness. The couscous was not as spongy as rice that I eat more frequently, but it did taste good with the hearty low-sodium broth. I especially liked the broth because it had natural sweetness from the boiled vegetables. The broth was light but still relatively savory, it tasted great even on its own.

Unfortunately, I was extremely let down by one aspect. I ordered lamb but I'm convinced that I received beef, although one of the servers assured me it was lamb. I don't think it was goat meat either. The lamb tasted really similar to the boiled beef stock that I add to my Chinese soup. No gamey flavor, tough resilient texture, very lean meat. It was my least favorite aspect of the tagine. In my opinion, using lamb or goat shanks (bone-in) would make the tagine taste infinitely better.

Nonetheless, I had a positive experience at Couscous Express. Hospitality was the most memorable aspect of the meal. Chef Abdul treats customers like family, and dining in felt like being a guest in his house. It's a one man show in the kitchen but he somehow finds time to bus tables. Chef Abdul even refilled my broth and bowl of couscous without asking. It's impossible to leave hungry from this place.

Between Couscous Express and Moroccan Paradise, I would pick Couscous Express if I wanted a more soupy and stew-like tagine, and choose Moroccan Paradise if I were craving for a more of a purely steamed bowl where a gravy is served on the side.";"10";"4";"5";"Couscous Express";"Phoenix";"AZ";"Vegan"

It was opened by one of the owners that left Khoa San Road.  The big difference is that you get cheaper and smaller plates to share. This is my reasoning behind the three stars.  I love small plates, but when I order Thai food, each dish is enough to share with three or four people for $10.  Here you get one scoop of a dish between three or four people for $8.  The two dollar drop in price equates to a lot less food and a much higher bill then you would get going out for Thai food.

A small bowl was $8.95 and a large bowl is $9.95. You basically try to stuff as much food as high as you legally can into this small bowl and have the chiefs cook the food in front of you, with 2 GIANT STICKS. Who doesn't think that is cool? It's pretty fun and challenging.

Anyways, The sauces there are excellent and have many variety of choices. There is a person on standby to assist you in choosing the correct sauce for your meal, in case you don't know what to pick. Avoiding an sauce mix up disaster. 

Eating here is significantly better than eating at an fast food restaurant. Also drinks, and soups are free. Including refills.

Service at this restaurant is excellent, 5/5 Stars.
The waiters are very consistent, helpful and very aware of your needs. 50 Cents to order an take out box. Not a big deal. Not to mention, the girls who work there are cute.

To sum up: 

Pros: Excellent Customer Service, Fun to go with a group of friends to try to out stack everybody else. Free refills on soup and drinks. Chief cooks for you with 2 sticks. Good value (if you can stack the food high) I recommend this restaurant, if your up for something new.

Cons: If you are new to this restaurant, and you don't know how to stack up the food, This may not be a good value to you. or if you prefer an real restaurant vs this type of restaurant. The food isn't as good as an normal restaurant, but given that this isn't an normal restaurant, This is not an drawback.";"0";"0";"0";"YC's Mongolian Grill";"Tempe";"AZ";"Vegan"

Leslieville is totally not on my list of neighborhoods for great food (with a few exceptions such as Goods & Provisions and Bobbette & Belle).   With that said I had always heard rave reviews from others about Glas Wine Bar and was excited when a friend decided to take me there for my birthday.

Glas Wine Bar doesn't wow you with its minimalist decor.  It's a quaint restaurant that seats around 25 with an open kitchen and bar.  I love that their wine list is Ontario-heavy which goes hand-in-hand with their mantra of local and seasonal ingredients.  It's also worth mentioning that they make a wicked Dirty Martini here.

I will forewarn that there were a few hiccups throughout the evening since chef/owner Dan Pantano was rolling out a new menu and training new kitchen staff.  There were even changes to the new menu as we sat down and our server explained some substitutions.  They ran out of the white wine I wanted and I had to send my glass of white wine back because it wasn't chilled properly.  I'm sure if I was there on any other day, these minor wrinkles may not exist...

Instead of a bread basket, we get a bowlful of assorted, candied nuts to start which I definitely didn't complain about.  My dining companion was worried I'd get full just chowing down on nuts.

We started out with a duo of crostini and fungus was the name of the game as we opted for mixed mushroom ragu and local ricotta, black truffle & honey ($3 each).  Both were good and the flavor profiles really melded together, especially the ricotta, black truffle and honey.

Continuing on with my love of things that come on boards, we opted for the Glas Tagliere ($18), which included a trio of local cheese, daily terrine, pickled veg and toasted bread.  The trio of cheeses were all from Quebec and included: Le Douanier (the Canadian doppelganger for French Morbier, a semi-soft cheese with a grey-blue ash made from maple wood), Bleu Bénédictin (another semi-soft cheese, made by monks) and Grey Owl (a surface-ripened goat's milk cheese).  The Douanier was definitely my favorite cheese, but it was the honey that was my favorite overall.

I am told that if you walk down the street to one of the neighborhood garages, you'll see a man who seldom smiles, but if you ask him how you can get a hold of his honey he's all smiles.  He gathers his honey from Quebec.  Gosh, maybe I should just book a trip to Quebec already!  I loved everything about this board.  The daily terrine was a ham hock terrine and it was also very delicious with a nice, crispy, golden crust.

The Beef Tartar ($14) was quite yummy and came on a bed of smoked potato salad and quail egg.  Can't say I've quite had a tartar like this before; usually the egg is raw and mixed in but I actually found the boiled egg made for a lighter, less rich tartar which was not a bad thing.  The potato salad was really different as it still had crunch and bite to it and wasn't over-boiled.

We kind of regretted ordering the 6 oz. Bavette Steak ($22) because a) we were pretty full and b) it wasn't all that amazing.  The spiced avocado mousse was a strange choice of accompaniment for a steak and the potato and onion ""pancake"" was really just a round smear of mashed potato.  With that said, the flank steak had great texture and was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I found their menu lacking when it came to choices with only 4 mains and 2 of the items because starch/grain (rigatoni and risotto); that's a lot of real estate to take up for mains.

Knowing that it was a birthday, the folks did bring out a dessert on the house; a Strawberry Rhubarb Tart with red wine syrup.  Though to be fair, it was more akin to a muffin than a tart.  It was very buttery and I loved the edible flowers that wreathed around the dessert.  Despite being full, I finished every crumb.

I would say I had a satisfactory dining experience at Glas.  The service was friendly and stellar and the food was good for the most part.  I would come back for drinks, tapas/shareables and dessert but probably skip the mains.

We stopped by for a couple slices after work, our bill came to about $9.00, she payed with a $50 bill. It wasn't until we got home that she realized he gave her only $11.00 back (as if she had paid with a $20). So we drive back and told him what had happened, and he said that he couldn't give us the correct change because he didn't know if it was true. He said we would have to wait for the next day for the manager to come in and check the cameras and balance the till. (He later said that HE was a manager... Not sure what was true). He even said he would deliver the money to us and give us a free pizza. And this went on for about 15 minutes. In my experience working in the customer service industry, we give the customer the correct change, and if we make a mistake, we fix it as soon as it comes to our attention. But this guy was making us feel like we were trying to scam him or something.

So we end up coming back the next day, the other manager is there, apologizes profusely, and says that the he has had issues with this other manager (or employee or whatever he is), and gives us our money back. Then I mention the free pizza we were offered and he says that that guy had no authority to offer that, and the owner doesn't offer us ANYTHING (despite the fact that we were short changed $30 and had to drive back and forth two times in order to get our money).

Don't go for lunch because it's a different experience. They cut out too many things.
I've been there a lot by virtue of working in the area and having one of my good friends stay in the area.


If you want to have a good time, this is the formula: 

Go on a monday or tuesday when you can bring your own wine for free.
If in a group, order a shit load of appetizers and try everything (for every one person, order 1.25 appetizers). Then share a bunch of entrees, at a ratio of about 2/3rd the number of people.
This way, you will each spend about $30 but you will be stuffed and have tried so many different things. 
This has been the winning formula in my experience. 
  
Service is good, fun, cool water service, nice at night!

oh and for dessert, you have to order the Knaffa ana. Normally this dish is made with warm cheese, but i ventured out and tried their version with

When I was little, every Friday my Dad would take my friend and I to a local donut shop in the bay area.  And because of those experiences, I have a place in my heart for donuts.  

When I went to Ronald's for the first time, I fell in love.  The donuts are fluffy and golden!  I'm the type of person who likes my donuts to be simple - plain or maple please (no fillings)!  Ronald's masters the art of donut creation.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  

I've introduced several of my friends to Ronald's over the years, and they've all remained loyal customers.  A box of donuts is extremely inexpensive, so be sure to spread the love and take a box or two to your work after stopping for yourself!  The presentation of the donuts (compared to other donut shops) is above average.  Almost like a piece of artwork in itself.  

For my birthday, my boss went out to buy some of their cinnamon roles to carry into the office that day... I hadn't ever tried the cinnamon roles, but they were just as good as the donuts, and everyone in the office approved!

I will admit that it has taken me longer than it should have to eat at the Market Grille Cafe, and I am sorry it took so long.  Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.  

I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.  

The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.  

I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.  

I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.

From my experience, it's an amazing lunch spot. It has a very easy going atmosphere, as the space is just a couple rooms in the lower floor of a building, and since the place rarely has more than a few other people in it, it's very quiet. In some settings this can be off putting, but around the Capitol it's a pleasant rarity to find a place so peaceful. Also, Layla (I think it was Layla at least) is the cook and server, and she's very sociable, and makes you feel welcome in her space.

In terms of food, it hits the spot in many ways. I ordered one of their stews (all of which can be made vegan, for those with diet restrictions), and it was a perfect lunch. The stew I ordered was a pomegranate walnut sauce, with butternut squash (vegan version only), and it was delicious with the side of rice. The salad you can get beforehand may be basic, but it's very yummy for what it is. Finally, GET THE BAKLAVA. It'll melt right in your mouth and make you go mmmmmmm. My entire meal was merely $9 as well, and it was well worth every cent.

The only con to Layla's I can think of are the hours. It's only open for lunch on weekdays, so pretty much anyone who doesn't work right in downtown won't have the chance to experience it. I'm sure it would do fine business on weekends, so Layla should consider having it open then.

Dry, far too dense, overpowering amount of sugar, particularly the weird taste of powdered sugar. This didn't taste much like lavender. It tasted like a fudgy brick of flour and sugar and hard frosting. Exactly like the Strawberry Fields cakes. Cakes are supposed to be fluffy and airy and creamy. Not so at Dancing Dog. Also costs over $5 per slice... Totally does not make sense considering the taste. 

Cole slaw tasted like coconut milk, which was a really off-putting flavor to have in this kind of dish. That is, a vegetable dish that is not supposed to make its substrate the star. The slaw was super watery too. 

The spaghetti and meatballs was mostly pasta. Flavorless. What meatballs there were dry. 

The reuben sandwich was the only acceptable part of this meal. I actually traded my spaghetti and meatballs dish for my friend's sandwich. If you ever find yourself here because you got lost on your way to a restaurant that serves good food, order this. 

Everything was overpriced for the quality of the dishes as well as the portions. This is the worst vegan cooking I have ever encountered. They actually do worse than meat-centered restaurants at vegan cuisine.

Cute little café with indoor and outdoor seating. They update their menu seasonally! I happen to be in the area and caught the happy hour specials. Happy Hour includes food and drinks. 

Happy Hour Portions: Raw Tacos Vivos and Falafel Slider
Both items are one serving each, and a great way to taste their menu. The Tacos Vivos has every taco topping you could possibly think of, it was fantastic. And they don't skimp on the guacamole! The falafel slider is served on their house bread, and it was a little dry for me, but the actual falafel was tasty.  

Entrée: Curried Sweet Potato Quesadilla
This was a seasonal item, and it was far better than I was expecting. The sweet potatoes with the tamarind salsa was a flavorful combination that brought the dish together. They have house hot sauces if you need an extra kick.  

This place is very popular for juices and coffees. I didn't get any but I would return for a fresh smoothie. They have a very extensive brunch menu and I would love to come back to try this. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.

I have come here so many times.. that it is official I am a local and a regular and they may know me by name. 

So.. What makes Kaleidoscope so special... well..

1. Waffles - The Waffles are delicious, best Waffles I have tried and since they are organic and all of that goodness, they are healthy in my mind.

2. Acai Bowl. No idea how to properly pronounce.. im going with ASEE-AH bowl for now, but anyhow it is Amazing. Add the Immortal Mix for an extra vitamin boost and it gets a nice little chocolatey flavor to it.

3. Immortal Shake - Oatmeal Cookie in a shake, but its healthy. It is really good and is a meal replacement BUT please mind that it is heavy I can only get through half. 

4. Pastries - Top - oh those protein doughnuts! and the cookies... and the brownie... ok everything.

It was a Monday Morning (I know, by far one of the more difficult mornings to get yourself up and at'em) and as I was waiting in line admiring the treats that were out on display, the associate at the counter was assisting the women in front of me as she was picking up an order. Another associate came out from the back, and was hoping to assist me, and I was speaking with him and asked about the cinnamon rolls availability as they were not displayed, the man I was dealing with, politely said ""You know, I'm not sure, let me check in the back for you."" As he just finished the statement the other associate yelled ""WE DON'T HAVE ANY!"" Alright sir, calm down! Came running to my head after being slightly taken back. Pretty startling to hear coming from someone you are not speaking to and from behind. I can understand he was hoping to save the man helping me some time, but all the same, assist the customer you are with before abruptly chiming in on a conversation. Then when I turned back around to the associate that was supposed to be helping me had walked away to the other room, without as much as recommendation to another item as you were out of the cinnamon rolls! I mean although the cinnamon roll was one of the reasons I went in, I would of course be buying other treats! I stood there and went back to looking at the case to make my other selections. Once the associate finished up with the women picking up, he returned to behind the counter and let me know that there were no more cinnamon rolls as the kitchen had run out of baking soda or was it powder? Whichever it was, it seems a tad silly to run out of such a key baking staple. 
We then began to go into my order and he was just the most unhelpful bakery associate I have encountered! It was like pulling teeth to get a recommendation! I get it, eating too much sweets I am sure some dental work is needed, but not when it's someone's JOB is to sell baked goods!  Also when someone inquiries about the reheating of one of your freezer products, best to have your associates well informed of how to advise a customer on doing so and making sound as though it would be just as tasty had it been fresh. I was told to ""leave the donuts out on the counter for 30 mins from them to come up to room temp and that they would taste alright""...Yea that sounds real appetizing!...As I ran down my list of items that I was going to get he went to bag each one instead of placing them in a pastry box, which once I noticed had to ask him to do so, and he obliged. When he got back and was placing everything in the box he was multitasking and rang me out prompting me to finish the transaction and stop looking away from the screen till it was complete. It seemed as though he just wanted to be done with me and move on, but it's not as if there was anyone in line behind me...so not sure what he was rushing me for. I mean if I want to continue to look and potentially add more to my check that would seem like something that would be promoted!
Also not sure if I was over charged for a small cream puff dipped in chocolate as I drove away noticed the receipt said $4.00 for a ""large cream puff""...My bad for not paying attention and asking.

By far one of the most disagreeable encounters I've had when walking into a bakery with such sweet treats! Please have your associates take a customer service training course! In my opinion if you're getting paid to be a customer facing associate, you had better smile with everything you have, when you talking with one!";"4";"1";"1";"Jewel's Bakery and Cafe";"Phoenix";"AZ";"Vegan"

The food was fresh and fantastic as usual. The server was kind and gracious. But the waiting time spoils the experience.

This is such a disgrace - Fresh should close their retail locations and rent an industrial space where they focus 100% on their new online restaurant concept where they're only focused on delivery food.

The Aristotle bowl comes with roasted sweet potato slices, spinach hummus, bruschetta topping, black olives, mixed greens, beets, carrots, broccoli, sprouted mung beans, spiced chickpeas, and hemp seeds. The dressing (which comes on the side) was a balsamic vinaigrette, but I actually didn't use any because I thought the bowl tasted perfect without any dressing.

All ingredients tasted fresh and the flavours blended really well together. The portion size is also excellent. The regular size is great for dinner. 

The restaurant was clean and staff were nice. They ask you for your name and they call your name out when your order is ready. Your name also appears on your receipt :)

Since moving to Tempe a few months ago, I am constantly on the lookout for new vegan/vegetarian spots. However, due to their very limited hours, I have never had a chance to make a visit to Desert Roots Kitchen until today.

I didn't immediately notice the restaurant from Mill Avenue because it is tucked away in a little square right behind the big store-fronts on the main sidewalk. Phew! This quaint, quiet location is totally befitting of their style of restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised at how calm the environment was considering its proximity to Mill Avenue in the middle of a school day. The front of the store has some patio seating where customers were easily able to sit undisturbed and read or chat over their meals. 

Upon entering, the staff was responsive and very positive. I told them it was my first visit and they explained the menu and encouraged me to sample the food before ordering anything. ...Don't mind if I do!! 

Everything I tasted was delicious, fresh, and made from scratch that same day. I ended up getting the Fresh Veggie & Kale Wrap with Lentils and their Garden Herb Spread. It came with a side of fruit, and the size of the wrap was very generous... I'm saving half of it for lunch tomorrow.

It was delicious. The flavors came together very well, and just thinking about those ingredients gives me a nice healthy feeling... a feeling that you don't frequently have after dining on the normal ice cream/burger/pizza fare served up at almost every other one of the restaurants on Mill.

The ambiance is hip yet casual and the waitresses look like typical hipster vegans with their multi-colored hair and septum piercings.  I quite like their living plant wall and plants hanging over the tables.  
. 
$42.62 got us some spaghetti and meatballs for the boy, an orange smoothie, a greek salad, a dumpling appetizer, and a quesadilla.  
.
$6.00 Orange burst smoothie- Consists of orange, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and pineapple. It is served in a cute mason jar which is appropriate because it tastes just like a scented candle.  
.
Sadly they were all out of the ""save the tuna"" vegan sushi so we had to settle for the My Little Dumpling appetizer for $6.95. The steamed shiitake & spinach dumplings were served in an adorable bamboo steamer basket.  I very much enjoyed these.  They are served with chopsticks and a tasty soy-based dipping sauce. 
.
$10.95 Muchas Gracias- Organic sweet potato quesadilla with black beans and chipotle crema.  Husband quite enjoyed this.  It was served very hot and fresh.  
.
$10.95 Greek salad- Has feta, kale, romaine, red peppers, green peppers, onions, vinagrette, olives, and oddly enough- tortilla chips.  I found the tortilla chips to be out of place in a greek salad but I enjoyed the vegan feta cheese more than I thought I would.  
.
$7.00 Chocolate tacos- Delicate crunchy pastry shell with chocolate goop, chopped strawberries, coconut, more mystery goop on top, and HUGE PIECES OF ROCK SALT...like the kind you use to make ice cream! I liked everything but the ginormous hunks of salt, which, according to our waitress and the chef, are supposed to be in there.  I sincerely hope nobody loses a tooth eating one of these.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off our bill.

That's alright because I didn't have ""mushroom"" in my tummy for dessert anyways.

I guess I happened to luck out by going all seafood the night I ate here. I'm not sure why, it might have had something to do with the fact that I was with my friend who is a vegetarian and I thought getting the fish may offend her less than say a heaping pile of carne asada. I am glad I did though. These tacos were soooo good. They are the perfect size too, so you can order a couple different ones and get a variety.

The night I went they were hosting a concert with a heavy metal band from Spain. That was really interesting to watch. This place definitely has that ""college divey venue"" feel. The bathroom is hideous, although not as bad as Double Down.

My only complaint is the tables are sticky gross. So if you can eat at the bar, it's much more clean. Supposedly there is a student discount for UNLV and CSN students - since I am neither of those things, it holds little consequence to me. I did note while there that some people there were complaining about the pricing here has risen. *shrug* Honestly I think it's pretty spot-on for what you're getting.

When I go back here I am getting the fish/shrimp tacos and the ceviche. Seriously, their ceviche was delicious! I am picky about my ceviche too because I've grown up on a recipe my father learned to make when he lived in Panama. So if a place can impress me with that, then I am definitely going back!";"2";"3";"1";"Yayo Taco";"Las Vegas";"NV";"Vegan"

We arrived on the opening weekend and they were slammed with a slight wait. The food was well worth the wait. Everything was fresh, good portion size and tasted amazing. Lots of options for meat loves and vegan/vegetarian. A REALLY extensive menu if you are vegan, one of the best I have seen in Vegas. 

The staff were a little overwhelmed with how busy it was, but they remained helpful and very friendly. We tried the fresh summer rolls, tom yum soup, and pad woon sen. Summer rolls were fresh, crispy and delicious and came with addictive chili sauce and creamy peanut sauce. Soup was spicy, lemongrassy and delicious. Good chunks of quality chicken. Pad woon sen was full of fresh crunchy veg and had a great flavor. We also had a fresh coconut juice and a butterfly pea lemongrass juice which tasted like the milk after a bowl of Trix (in the greatest way possible!)

Overall an amazing meal and so so so excited to have an excellent Thai option in Green Valley. My new go-to in Vegas.";"6";"1";"4";"Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan";"Henderson";"NV";"Vegan"
