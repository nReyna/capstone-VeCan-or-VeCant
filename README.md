### 1. Goal: classify businesses by their review text. 

In particular, taking Yelp reviews for food establishments can we infer a classification 
for the type of cuisiine using review text. We start with a collection of 5.2 million 
reviews for a diverse set of business. After joining and subsetting we have ### 
remaining of which we can see a class balance from Fig. 1.


Figure 1: We see the different classes represented by the food related reviews 
(appendix list of categories) on the horizontal axis versus the category count.
