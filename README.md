### 1. Goal: classify dinning options by their review text to predict if they are Vegan/Vegetarian friendly

In particular, taking Yelp reviews for food establishments can we infer a classification 
for the type of cuisiine using review text. We start with a collection of 5.2 million 
reviews for a diverse set of business. After joining and subsetting we have ### 
remaining of which we can see a class balance from Fig. 1.


Figure 1: We see the different classes represented by the food related reviews 
(appendix list of categories) on the horizontal axis versus the category count.

### 0. Appendix
**Yelp Dataset SQL Tables**

Here is the table association and structure which can be found [link](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/sql):

In *iteration 1* of this project, we will be looking at the reviews for a small 
subset of categories of the broader food set.
